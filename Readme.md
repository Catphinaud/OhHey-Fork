## Description

Oh Hey! Fork is a Dalamud plugin that has two main features currently:
- Notifying you when someone targets you
- Notifying you when someone emotes at you

The plugin notifies you with a text message (only visible to you) and can optionally play a notification sound.\
Additionally it tracks the most recent notification events with a simple interface.

Recent fork updates include:
- No duplicate emote chat messages (from the server emote usage + the plugin's Oh Hey! emote usage)
- Ability to reply with emote (including being able to reply silently)
- Emote rate limiting so its less spammy.
- Notification channel options so it can be put on one chat tab and not spam the others.
- Clickable character names, Cross-world name display support in notifications.
- Debug Emote browser and additional mapped emotes.
